# Ideas/brainstorming

Some rough notes based on Tuesday's meeting (19th February 2019). 

### Plan
* Start with a simplified model for the neutrino energies and arrival directions
* Within this, at first consider only one neutrino flavour and cascade events (CC + NC)
* Once this is working (ie. can fit sims under modelling assumptions) can extend to full problem
* Eventual idea to extend in some way to multimessenger case
* Feel it could be sould to separate things into method/more general model and some specific physics scenarios

### Things to eventually include
* Catalogue selection/incompleteness
* Source physics - spectral information/lum. function
* Source evolution parameters
* Background energy model

### Thoughts/questions
* How does eventual science question feed back into modelling choices?
  * Computational considerations may influence what we are able to do
* Who can/wants to help?
  * Once things are going would be good to have some input on physical scenarios
  * Gamma-ray/cosmic ray/neutrino connection
  * Gamma-ray source properties/categorisation
