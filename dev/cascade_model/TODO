1) fix energy binning "bug" in inelasticity sampler, i.e. assume original y-samples are sampled on energy grid, rather than energy bins

2) implement energy resolution as function of energy deposited

3) implement directional resolution as function of energy deposited

4) implement light reduction of hadronic component
