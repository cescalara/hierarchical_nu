# Cascade parametrization coefficents

JSON files in this directory contain dictionaries with coeffients for polynomials for the parametrization of the cascade detection probabiltiy $P(E_\matrhm{rec} | E_\nu)$ for the NC and CC models respectively. Produced by fitting the NC or CC model to the simulated events. The polynomial coefficients are ordered in a way where the first element of each array is of the largest order, while the last element is of 0th order. The arrays of polynomials for each interaction channel can be retrieved by passing its name to the dictionaries. The NC_parameters file includes all NC interaction channels, as well as nutau_CC and nutaubar_CC, as their PDFs are better described by the NC model. The CC_parameters file includes the remainder. Please see the cascade_parametrization.stan file for a description of the models.
