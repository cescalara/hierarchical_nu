These files contain information intended to make it practical to compute expected event rates for theoretical fluxes which may be compared to the observations of this analysis. 

## effective_area.h5 ##

This file contains the effective areas for this analysis which account for the propagation of neutrinos through the Earth, interaction to produce secondaries, detection of the secondaries by IceCube, and the data selection criteria. To facilitate a variety of calculations, the effective areas have not been averaged over different detector configurations or particle types, so as a result eight different tables are provided, in the groups labeled by year and particle type. (This analysis is assumed to insensitive to electron neutrinos/antineutrinos, so no tables are included for these particle types.) Each table is binned in both true event parameters, for interfacing with theoretical models, and in experimental observables, for interfacing with observations. As a simplifying assumption, true and reconstructed event zenith angle are assumed to be the same to within the binning used, so only three dimensions are required: true neutrino energy, true/reconstructed neutrino zenith angle (transformed to the cosine for constant solid angle per bin), and reconstructed muon energy proxy. It is worth noting that the astrophysical flux results given in the paper are per flavor, assuming equal components of neutrinos and anti neutrinos, and so should be divided by two to yield per particle type fluxes for use in combination with these effective areas. 

The bin edges for each effective area are stored alongside it in a series of separate, one dimensional datasets named bin_edges_N, when n is an integer labeling the dimension for which the dataset contains the bin edges. It should be noted that each set of bin edges contains one more entry than the number of bins in that dimension, as the right edge of the final bin is also included to prevent ambiguity. 

The livetime for each experimental detector configuration is also recorded in this file, as an attribute named 'experimental_livetime(seconds)' attached to the group for each detector configuration (2010 and 2011). As the attribute name indicates, the livetime is measured in seconds. 

Finally, for each effective area, an uncertainty table is also included. These tables contain the per-bin uncertainty due to the finite simulation statistics used to produce the tables, and can be propagated through expectation calculations to assess this statistical uncertainty on estimates which are made. These uncertainties should be fractions of a percent for energies of TeV to tens of TeV, but can become large at ~PeV energies. 

## effective_area_demo.c ##

This simple C program, which requires only the standard library and the HDF5 library (in order to read the input data), demonstrates using the effective area to compute event number expectations, taking into account a few subtleties which might not otherwise be obvious to the user. As it has few dependencies, it should be possible to compile it with a command similar to:

	$CC effective_area_demo.c -lm -lhdf5 -o effective_area_demo
	
where $CC is your C compiler (e.g. gcc or clang). Depending on where you have installed the HDF5 headers and library and where your compiler searches by default it may be necessary to add `-I` and `-L` flags so that they can be found correctly. 

Calculating an expected number of events for a flux model is then largely a matter of computing the average flux in each true parameter bin, multiplying with the effective area and the phase space in the bin, and summing bins to project out non-observable (or uninteresting) dimensions. There is one important caveat, however: Systematic error in the simulation of the detector optical efficiency must be accounted for, and this effect, somewhat unintuitively, depends on the input neutrino spectrum. This occurs because varying the simulated detector efficiency alters the relationship between true event energies and the observable energy proxy. In general, the effect is complex, but in the high energy regime where many photons are present and for simple power law spectra the effect can be derived by simple algebra. This correction is included in the example code (for the sake of simplicity it is computed as part of the flux), but users should beware that it is 1) not strictly correct at low energies (<1 TeV) and 2) does not hold for fluxes which are not unbroken power laws. The effective areas which are provided include the exact correction required for an unbroken E^{-2} flux, so fluxes similar to this will have only small errors, while fluxes with more different forms will have larger errors. Since the conventional atmospheric flux is of particular interest, and it has a shape which cannot be described as a simple power law, both the integrated flux (with the same binning as the effective areas) and the necessary efficiency correction are included in an additional file 'conventional_flux.h5'. 

This demo program simply computes the expected number of events as a function of the energy observable first for the best-fit astrophysical flux and then for the conventional atmospheric flux, and displays both with 1 sigma statistical uncertainties. 

## conventional_flux.h5 ##

This file contains the conventional atmospheric neutrino flux model used in this analysis, integrated over the same bins as the those for which the effective area is made available. The flux itself is provided for both muon neutrinos and antineutrinos in the correspondingly named groups. The bin edges for the histograms are also stored, in a manner analogous to the effective area tables. The correction for the simulated detector optical efficiency is provided for both the 2010 and 2011 detector configurations in the 'detector_correction' group, and again the bin edges are provided alongside. 

## angular_resolution.pdf ##

This file is a plot depicting the angular resolution expected for events in this sample. The resolution shown is the median within each energy proxy bin. It is noticeable that the expected resolution differs somewhat based on the assumed spectrum; this effect does not appear when the resolution is computed as a function of true event energy, but when the experimental observable is used the distribution of true energies which map to each observable range depends slightly on the spectrum. The effect is not large, however, and in general the resolution for all events in this sample is good compared to the size of the zenith angle binning used for analysis.
